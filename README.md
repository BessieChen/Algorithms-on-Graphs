# Algorithms-on-Graphs
This course covers several ways to traverse graphs and how to do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. It also talks about shortest paths algorithms.â€” from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services.
